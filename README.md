Recently, I have been taking time to put out simple codes for beginners. 
This repository contains three basic mathematical projects for newbies in Python programming language.
The third file is about using creating a user-defined function, using initializer, class and subclass to solve basic mathemathical questions, which could be modified anytime.
Reach out to 09018062646, if you have more questions.
