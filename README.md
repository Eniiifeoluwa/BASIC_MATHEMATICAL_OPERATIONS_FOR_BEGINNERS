Recently, I have been taking time to put out simple codes for beginners. 
This repository contains three basic mathematical projects for newbies in Python programming language.
This first file is about using the list and split method to create arrays of the dimensions of your choice.
The second file is a program that receives integers as input from user, the output the factorial of the user's given number. Factorial is calculated, multiplying the given number by the successors till it gets to one. i.e The factorial of 7, is: 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. Anf Factorial is denoted as '!'
The third file is about using creating a user-defined function, using initializer, class and subclass to solve basic mathemathical questions, which could be modified anytime.
Reach out to 09018062646, if you have more questions.
